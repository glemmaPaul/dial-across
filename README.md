# Dial Across the Aisle ☎️ 🇺🇸

This is the backend organizing the calls coming in from [dialacross.us](http://dialacross.us). By using the Twilio TwiML implementation we control how calls get connected and give certain ways to give feedback on calls.

## Stack/Services

- Node.js

- Twilio Audio/Text
