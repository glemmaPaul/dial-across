                <h2>Hello</h2>
                <p>
                Welcome to Dial across the aisle, a good old fashioned toll-free number that puts people of different political leanings in touch with each other.
                </p>

                <h3>Why should we do this?</h3>
                <p>
                We’re not as divided as we seem. Most people want peace and prosperity for all. Their politics are more about telling their life stories than waging ideological warfare. We’re hoping the two sides will see each other’s essential humanity and realize we’re all more alike than different.
                </p>

                <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                <p>Just call and choose which type of person you’d like to talk to. We have curious, open-minded callers of all beliefs who, like you, want to learn about other types of people. It’s a level playing field, with each side seeking a new perspective and appreciation for their fellow Americans.
                </p>


                <h3>How can I get involved?</h3>
                <p>Do you keep up with the issues? Do you live in the United States? Looking to understand the big picture amid all this uncertainty? If this sounds like you, consider signing up to take a few calls a week. You get to pick a time that works for your schedule. And no spam, promise! If this feels like a lot and you’d rather dip your toes in the water before jumping in, you can just call the number and chat with one of the participants that signed up to receive calls :) </p>
